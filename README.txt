Thanks for checking out my thing!

This program is a GUI tool designed as a replacement to the deck of cards and character sheet that are normally required to play my card game, TimeLost.

While I will not explain the rules of the game, I will shed light on things that may be confusing to someone who has not played the game before:
- Focus can be considered synonymous to a Stamina stat that would typically be found in a video game (like HP)
- The Radio Buttons with the labels Body, Mind, Soul, Essence describe the different types of attacks/actions that a character can take (these are represented by each of the 4 suits, when using a deck of cards)
  - Which button is selected in each category reflects how much XP has been allocated to that stat, and is automatically added to the total of actions related to that stat.
- Attacks can be any stat, while Defending and Countering have explicit associations with Body and Mind, respectively, so no stat needs to be chosen when making those types of actions.
- Sometimes players need more flexible probabilities for some game functions, so the Draw! button has been included for that scenario (it is essentially a Random Number Generator that also chooses a random stat for convenience).
- Characters have certain items that give bonuses to different stats, which the inventory tab can help keep a record of

It is recommended that the .jar file for the game be kept in it's own dedicated directory on the host computer,
 as this will make it more convenient to save characters, as the tool (currently) always opens up save/load dialogs from the directory the tool is in.
 This will make it easier to access files, simply by saving all characters in the same folder as the .jar file itself.

Future plans for the project include:
Small stuff:
- Actual documentation (haha, yeah my bad)
- Optimization of the inventory serialization process
- Make the save/load dialog box open in the last directory saved in/loaded from, for convenience.
Big Stuff:
- Allowing for the selection of items during Attack/Defend/Counter actions, to be incorporated into the result of the action
  - This is the reason for the  "Ites Used" placeholder in the Action Result window
- Adding some sort of way to keep track of which items in the character's inventory are currently equipped (This is an important game mechanic)
- Adding a pane similar to the Inventory pane that keeps tracks of a character's abilities, though I have reservations about being able to include that in action results as those are explicitly more versatile in the rules for the game. Time will tell.
